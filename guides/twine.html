<h1>Twine</h1>
<p>It doesn't take a huge team of people to make a game -- you can create one yourself using a free software package called Twine.</p>
<p>Twine is story telling tool with a difference. In a conventional narrative, the reader follows the path laid out for them by the author. By contrast, Twine is designed to create interactive texts that enable readers to make choices and to participate in the shaping of the story. Twine projects are made up of of words, hyperlinks and images. What they are about is up to you.</p>
<p>Perhaps you want to show your readers two different perspective on the same event. Using Twine, you could create a branching narrative that would allow the reader to first see one side of the story and then to return and try the other branch.</p>
<p>Perhaps you want to immerse your reader in the action and help them better understand the predicament of a person trapped in a difficult situation. You could lay out the nature of the challenge in your story then offer readers the chance to choose the path they want to follow so that they can better appreciate the nature of the problem.</p>

<h1> Getting Started with Twine</h1>
<p>Visit <a href="https//twinery.org">Twinery.org</a> and download the software to your own computer. You can use the program in your browser, but it is much better to have it on your local machine because then it saves to your harddrive. You never know when you might clear the cache on your browser and then destroy all your work.</p>
<p>The first time you run Twine it may offer you an introduction, but if you skip by that you will find yourself at an empty starting screen. Find the big green button that says 'story' and click on it. You will have to give it a name and then the program will take you to a grid with a single box on it that says 'untitled passage'.</p>
<p>Double click on your first passage and it will open a view that enables you to add some text to your passage. Write what you like. The default storymode includes a set of codes and macros that enables you to add features to your text, such as hyperlinks. You can use the tool bar or you can simply write the codes yourself. The most important code is for hyperlinks. If you add two sets of square brackets around a phrase Twine will recognize that you want to create a link to a new passage. For example, [[Choice 1]], [[Choice 2]]. Your reader will see these as options to click on. If they do they will go to a new passage.</p>

<p>Once you understand how to download Twine and to use the default story mode to create a interactive text you have all the tools you need to create a basic project. There is <b>much</b> more to Twine. Twine is fundamentally a website building tool so most of things you can do in a normal website you can also include in your Twine project, including colors, images, sounds.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more, please visit the center for digital humanities, take a look at some of the documentation online, read a book, watch a youtube video, or look at some of the other projects that people have put up online.</p>
<p>When you are finished building your project, we can help you put it up online.</p>
